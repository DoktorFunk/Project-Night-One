To add entries to the glossary, you only need to touch dataset.csv.

The format is the following:

button_image,text_image,

make sure you DON'T put a space in between button_image, and text_image,
make sure you end each line with a comma

Example input:
bmp\r_click\r_btn_system.bmp,bmp\r_click\text\cha\ham_1.bmp,
bmp\r_click\r_btn_system.bmp,bmp\r_click\text\cha\hig_1.bmp,


Final note:
because the file is in .csv format, your computer might want you to edit it with excel or open office calc.
Don't do that, just use a plain text editor like notepad++ or wordpad. Excel & friends will mangle the format.
