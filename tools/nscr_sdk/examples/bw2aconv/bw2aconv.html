<p>bw2aconv.exe is a simple alpha-layer mask creation tool.<br>
  <br>
  ÅÉHow To UseÅÑ<br>
  Please place a number of BMP files, designated *_b.bmp,*_w.bmp into a directory, and then set bw2aconv to use that directory.  A subdirectory called "out" will be created within that directory, and within it the alpha masks for the bmps will be generated.
  <br>
  ÅÉAbout The ConversionÅÑ<br>
  Creating alpha masks for BMP files is known to be a laborious process, and this tool is designed to speed that process up somewhat.  Here is an example of how it works, and what it requires.  Let us say that we have a graphic file to make an alpha mask for, "alice.bmp".<br>
  <ol>
  	<li>First, we'll take alice.bmp, strip away its background if it exists, and make its background pure white.</li>
  	<li>Then, we'll save this file as alice_w.bmp:</li>
  	<img src="alice_w.jpg" width="333" height="467">
	<li>Then, we'll make alice.bmp's background pure black, and save is as alice_b.bmp:</li>
  	<img src="alice_b.jpg" width="333" height="467"><br>
  	<li>And then we'll place alice_w.bmp and alice_b.bmp in the same folder.</li>
  	<li>Then we'll run bw2aconv.exe on that folder.</li>
  	<li>A folder entitled "out" will be generated in that folder, and in that folder we should se a file simply entitled "alice.bmp".  In other words, in the root folder you can have any number of (name)_w.bmp (name)_b.bmp pairs, and once you run bw2aconv you'll get a bunch of (name).bmp's inside the out/ folder:</li>
  	<img src="alice.jpg" width="650" height="459"> </p>
  	</ul>
